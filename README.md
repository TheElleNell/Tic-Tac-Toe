# Tic-Tac-Toe

**Project Name**

Tic Tac Toe Underwater Edition

**Project Description**

My game is tic tac toe where two players can try to get 3 in a row on a board. Each player will go one at a time and click the area they pick for their selection. However my version will be held underwater and therefore will be turtle vs whale. Players will attempt to get 3 in a row for a turtle or whale. When a player gets 3 in a row they will win the game.
