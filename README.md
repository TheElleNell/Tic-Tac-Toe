Project Name

Tic Tac Toe Underwater Edition

Project Description

My game is tic tac toe where two players can try to get 3 in a row on a board. Each player will go one at a time and click the area they pick for their selection. However my version will be held underwater and therefore will be turtle vs whale. Players will attempt to get 3 in a row for a turtle or whale. When a player gets 3 in a row they will win the game.

User Stories

As player 1, I want to choose any square to put my whale into.

As player 2, I want to choose any square besides the one player 1 chose, and put my turtle into it.

I want to repeat this until the game is over.

For both players, I want to be able to win the game by getting three in a row of my animal.

I want the game to be able to notify the players when the game is over and a specific player wins.
